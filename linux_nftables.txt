# NFTables


For decades, iptables has been the preferred packet filtering system in the Linux kernel.
Used extensively across the Kubernetes networking ecosystem, iptables is now on the way out and is expected to be removed from the next generation of Linux distributions.

... The successor to iptables -- nftables -- is ready to carry the torch instead, with a newly released beta kube-proxy implementation
in v1.31 and network policy using Calicoâ€™s nftables backend.
