# OBSERVABILITY: LOGING+MONITORING+TRACING

* Observability is about inferring the internal state of an app from its external outputs.
* Manageability is about changing internal state and output from external inputs.
* In both cases, the application artifact is never changed.  It's immutable.
* As of 2024+, OpenTelemetry (<https://opentelemetry.io/>), is the emerging suite-of standards
  for (Cloud Native) Observability, providing integration with existing observability SaaS 
  (Honeycomb, Datadog, Stackdriver, ...)

* The Observability Engineering team at Twitter identifies four pillars
  of observability:
  * Monitoring: Monitoring is about measuring specific aspects of an
    application to get information on its overall health and identify
    failures.
    (e.g:  export to Prometheus of relevant metrics about the
    application).
  * Alerting/visualization: When a failure is identified while monitoring
    an application, an alert should be triggered, and some action should
    be taken to handle it.  (email, grafana, ...)
  * Distributed systems tracing infrastructure: trace the data flowing
    through the different subsystems. (e.g: Spring Cloud Sleuth integrated with Jaeger)
  * Log aggregation/analytics: Keeping track of the main events in an
    application is critical to infer the software’s behavior and debug
    it if something goes wrong.
      In a cloud nativesystem, logs should be aggregated and collected to
    provide a better picture of the system behavior and have the possibility
    of running analytics to mine information from thosedata.
    E.g: ELK (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana) or  EFK (Elastic, Fluentd, Kibana)

## Zipkin B3 request-tracing Standard

* identifiers used to place an operation in a TRACE TREE.
* These attributes are propagated in-process, and eventually 
downstream (often via http headers), to ensure all activity 
originating from the same root are collected together.
* A sampling decision is made at the root of the trace, and this 
indicates if trace details should be collected and reported to the 
tracing system (usually Zipkin) or not.

# Overall Process
## use-case 1: copy trace-context from client··>server request.
* same span ID is used
  ```
  => client and server end up in the same node in the trace tree.
  ```
* Ex flow: (Assumption: HTTP request carries the propagated trace)
  ```

  |  TraceId         X-B3-TraceId      : (128|64) bits shared by every span

  |  ParentSpanId    X-B3-ParentSpanId : 64 bits, position of parent  operation in trace tree
  |                                      ("empty" for root)
  |  SpanId          X-B3-SpanId       : 64 bits, position of current operation in trace tree

  |          (not yet sent to tracer)
  |*Deny   : achieve probabilistic rate or prevent certain paths from tracing (health checks,...).
  |*Accept : Ensure that certain paths are always traced (in a probablistic way,..),
  |*Debug: : `X-B3-Flags: 1` (least common use case) like Accept, but additionally reporting
  |          `Span.debug = true` for each span in the trace.

*  multi-header HTTP : `X-B3-...` headers (2012)

  |X-B3-Sampled: 1
   ------------
   case-insensitive for HTTP,
   case-  sensitive for other transports.
  ```
* single-header HTTP :
  ```
  |b3: 0                                <·· single sampling decision,
  |                                         header still named `b3`
  |b3: 80f...-e457b5a2e4d86bd1-1-05e3...
  |    └─────────────┬─────────────────┘

  |   non-128b: 
  |   128-bits: 
  |   epoch128: 128-bit prefixed with  32 bits epoch seconds
                It can  be translated into an Amazon Web Services ID.
                that can pass through ELBs for example.

## Autometrics!! [[{low_code,qa.UX]]
<https://github.com/autometrics-dev>
* Why Autometrics?  Simplifying code-level observability
* Many modern observability tools promise to make life "easy for
  developers" by automatically instrumenting your code with an agent or
  eBPF. Others ingest tons of logs or traces -- and charge high fees
  for the processing and storage.
* Most of these tools treat your system as a black box and use complex
  and pricey processing to build up a model of your system. This,
  however, means that you need to map their model onto your mental
  model of the system in order to navigate the mountains of data.
* Autometrics takes the opposite approach. Instead of throwing away
  valuable context and then using compute power to recreate it, it
  starts inside your code. It enables you to understand your production
  system at one of the most fundamental levels: from the function:
    It makes it easy to instrument any function with the most useful
  metrics: request rate, error rate, and latency. Autometrics uses
  instrumented function names to generate Prometheus queries so you
  don't need to hand-write complicated PromQL.
