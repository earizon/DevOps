## Github actions summary


(Mistral generated)

* Here’s a conceptual Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram for the main GitHub Actions
  entities, focusing on core components and their relationships. Since I can’t 
  generate visual diagrams directly, I’ll describe the entities, attributes, and
  relationships in a structured format (you can use tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io,
  or Mermaid.js to visualize it).

  ```
  | Entities & Attributes
  | 
  | (Key entities in GitHub Actions workflows)
  | 
  | Entity
  | Attributes
  | Description
  | Workflow
  | id, name, file_path (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml), trigger_events,
  | created_at, updated_at
  | Defines the automated process (e.g., CI/CD pipeline). Triggered by
  | events like push, pull_request, or schedule.
  | Job
  | id, name, runs_on (OS/environment), steps, dependencies, status
  | (success/failure)
  | A set of steps executed on the same runner. Jobs can depend on other jobs.
  | Step
  | id, name, uses (action/reusable workflow), run (command), env
  | (variables), if (conditional)
  | Individual task in a job (e.g., checkout code, run tests).
  | Action
  | id, name, repository, version (e.g., v1), inputs, outputs
  | Reusable unit of code (e.g., actions/checkout@v4). Can be public/private.
  | Runner
  | id, name, os (linux/windows/macos), labels, status (busy/idle)
  | Machine that executes jobs (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted).
  | Event
  | id, type (e.g., push, pull_request), payload (commit SHA, branch)
  | Triggers workflows (e.g., code push, issue comment).
  | Artifact
  | id, name, path, expiration_date, workflow_run_id
  | Files generated during a workflow (e.g., build outputs, logs).
  | Secret
  | id, name, value (encrypted), repository_id, environment
  | Sensitive data (e.g., API keys) injected into workflows.
  | Environment
  | id, name, protection_rules, secrets
  | Deployment targets (e.g., production, staging) with access controls.
  | Workflow Run
  | id, workflow_id, status, conclusion, started_at, completed_at
  | Instance of a workflow execution.

  | Relationships
  | 
  | (How entities interact)
  | 
  | Relationship
  | Description
  | Cardinality
  | Workflow has many Jobs
  | A workflow contains one or more jobs.
  | 1:N
  | Job has many Steps
  | A job consists of sequential steps.
  | 1:N
  | Step uses Action
  | A step may reference an action (or run a shell command).
  | 1:1 or 1:N (if reusable)
  | Job runs on Runner
  | A job is executed by a runner (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted).
  | N:1
  | Workflow triggered by Event
  | Workflows start when an event occurs (e.g., push to main).
  | N:1
  | Workflow Run generates Artifact
  | A run can produce zero or more artifacts.
  | 1:N
  | Job depends on Job
  | Jobs can have dependencies (e.g., job2 waits for job1).
  | N:N (via needs keyword)
  | Workflow uses Secret
  | Workflows/steps access secrets (e.g., ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}).
  | N:N
  | Job deploys to Environment
  | Jobs can target environments (e.g., production).
  | N:1

  | 
  | Key Notes for the ER Diagram
  | 
  | Hierarchy: Workflow → Job → Step → (Action or Shell Command).
  | Triggers: Events (e.g., push, pull_request) are external to workflows
  | but critical for execution.
  | Reusability: Actions and workflows can be shared across repositories
  | (model as weak entities if needed).
  | Concurrency: Workflow runs and jobs may execute in parallel (highlight
  | with dashed lines if modeling concurrency).

  | Example Mermaid.js Code
  | 
  | To generate the diagram programmatically, use this template in a
  | Mermaid-compatible tool (e.g., GitHub Markdown):
  | 
  |  Copiar
  | erDiagram
  |     WORKFLOW ||--o{ JOB : contains
  |     JOB ||--o{ STEP : includes
  |     STEP ||--|| ACTION : uses
  |     JOB }|--|| RUNNER : "runs on"
  |     WORKFLOW ||--o{ WORKFLOW_RUN : "triggers"
  |     WORKFLOW_RUN ||--o{ ARTIFACT : generates
  |     WORKFLOW ||--o{ SECRET : uses
  |     JOB }|--|| ENVIRONMENT : "deploys to"
  |     WORKFLOW ||--|| EVENT : "triggered by"
  | 
  |     WORKFLOW {
  |         string id PK
  |         string name
  |         string file_path
  |         string[] trigger_events
  |     }
  |     JOB {
  |         string id PK
  |         string name
  |         string runs_on
  |         string status
  |     }
  |     ACTION {
  |         string id PK
  |         string name
  |         string repository
  |     }
  ```

## Rendergit

Tired of clicking around complex file hierarchies of GitHub repos? Do you just 
want to see all of the code on a single page? Enter rendergit. Flatten any 
GitHub repository into a single, static HTML page with syntax highlighting, 
markdown rendering, and a clean sidebar navigation. Perfect for code review, 
exploration, and an instant Ctrl+F experience.
