# Traefik Reverse Proxy

* Cloud Native (k8s, ...) application proxy.

* Automate the discovery, routing, and load balancing of microservices.

* Out of the box routing, observability and Security [[security.AAA]]


## The Traefik Labs Manifesto: The Case for a Unified Runtime Layer

### The problem: ... two decades of rational technology choices have produced an 
  irrational result.

virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, serverless platforms, public clouds,
private clouds, sovereign regions, and edge locations, each with its own
governance model, ingress pattern, networking assumptions, security policies, 
API conventions and operational culture. ...  Each choice made sense in
isolation. Collectively, they created chaos.

... Agentic systems require stable APIs, trustworthy identity, predictable
governance, end-to-end visibility, context-aware access, and consistency across 
environments.

The Solution: A Unified Runtime Layer for All Workloads above the execution
environments but below the application logic.
- It standardizes how traffic flows, how identity is enforced, how APIs are
exposed, how workloads are protected, and how intelligence is applied. 

Our Principles

- Consistent governance everywhere: Policies must be defined once and applied 
  universally across Kubernetes, VMs, and edge nodes. By enforcing standards like 
  OAS (OpenAPI Specification) at the definition level, we transform loose 
  integrations into strict, governable contracts.
- Universal connectivity: VMs, containers, functions, and legacy systems must 
  behave like a single addressable estate. Connectivity is not negotiable. It is 
  the baseline requirement for everything that follows.
- Intelligent (Layer 7) routing by default. Modern workloads need more than 
  routing. They need context-aware decisions, semantic caching, and policy 
  enforcement that understands intent rather than just packets.
- Security as a standard, not an add-on, not a workaround, no 
  environment-specific compromises.
- Complete observability across all traffic. Every request, response, and
  failure must be traceable. 
- Sovereignty and edge readiness. 
- Developer experience is not cosmetic. Systems must be easy to use to be 
  adopted.


Our product suite embodies this vision:

-          Traefik Proxy: unifies ingress, routing, and traffic management across 
  containers (Kubernetes, ECS, Swarm, Nomad, etc.), VMs, and hybrid
  architectures.
-    Traefik API Gateway: brings consistent identity, policy enforcement, and 
  visibility to every environment.
-     Traefik AI Gateway: manages AI inference traffic as a first-class workload, 
  handling guardrails, cost controls, and semantic caching.
-    Traefik MCP Gateway: ensures agentic AI systems interact with enterprise 
  infrastructure safely and predictably.
- Traefik API Management: provides comprehensive governance, from developer 
  portals to GitOps-driven operations at scale.

- Organizations can start with any Traefik Labs product and add capabilities 
  seamlessly, in seconds, as requirements change. This makes our entire suite 
  less a collection of tools and more a platform with a clear point of view.
