# Bore: Simple port forwarder

* <https://github.com/ekzhang/bore>

* about 400 lines of safe, async Rust code. Binary shared by client and servers.
* TCP tunnel bypassing NATs by exposing local to remote post (no more, and no less)
* Similar to localtunnel or ngrok, highly efficient, unopinionated.
