## What's new

Note: (mistral AI) answer:
Q: list core features added to different releases of git. For example  Git 2.28 
   takes advantage of 2.27 commit-graph optimizations to deliver a handful of 
   sizeable performance improvement. Render output as raw markdown.


- Git 2.40:
  * <https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/04/git-releases-version-2-40/>
- Git 2.39:
  - Built-in support for sparse checkouts, making it easier to work with large repos
    by only checking out needed files.
  - Improved `git maintenance`: More robust background maintenance tasks.

- Git 2.38:
  - `git rebase --update-refs`: Safer rebase with automatic ref updates.
  - `git diff --color-moved=dimmed-zebra`: Better visualization of moved code.

- Git 2.37: (mix AI/human)
  - <https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/06/git-2-37-released/>
  - Built-in File Monitor, Improved Pruning, ...
  - merge-tree: New command for 3-way merge of blobs. [[storage.blogs]]
  - `git repack --filter=blob:none`: Exclude blobs from repacks, useful for monorepos.[[storage.blogs]]

- Git 2.36:
  - `git restore --staged --worktree`: Restore both staged and working tree files.
  - `git branch --show-current`: Always show the current branch name.

- Git 2.35: (human verified)
  - Git 2.35 includes a couple of new additions to SSH signing. [[PM.TODO]]
    - track which SSH keys you trust, you use the ALLOWED SIGNERS FILE
      to store the identities and public keys of signers you trust.
      PROBLEM: NOW suppose one commiter rotates their key.
      * You could update their entry in the allowed signers file
        but that would make it impossible to validate objects signed with
        the older key.
      * You could store both keys, but that would mean that you
        would accept new objects signed with the old key.
    - Git 2.35 SOLUTION: take advantage of OpenSSH’s valid-before and
      valid-after directives.
  - Git 2.35 also supports new key types in the user.signingKey
     configuration when you include the key verbatim (instead of storing
     the path of a file that contains the signing key). Previously, the
     rule for interpreting user.signingKey was to treat its value as a
     literal SSH key if it began with “ssh-“, and to treat it as
     filepath otherwise. You can now specify literal SSH keys with
     keytypes that don’t begin with “ssh-” (like ECDSA
     keys).[source, source]

- Git 2.27: (human verified)
 - bloom filters added to commit-graph file format .
   to search in history much faster by skipping commits
   not affecting files of interest
   (git log -- <path>, or git blame) [[git.performance]]

- 2.25: (human verified)
  Sparse checkouts are one of several approaches Git supports to improve
  performance when working with big(huge or monolithic) repositories.
   They are useful to keep working directory clean by specifying which
  directories to keep. This is useful, for example, with repositories
  containing thousands of directories.

- Git 2.23:
  - `git switch` and `git restore`: New commands for branch and file operations. [[git.101]]
  - `git stash push --pathspec-from-file`: Stash specific files from a file list.
