# Open Telemetry observability framework ("OTel")

* OTEL is the result of mergin OpenTracing and OpenCensus, both deprecated now
  if favor of Opentracing.  [[monitoring.OpenTracing,monitoring.OpenCensus,doc_has.comparative]].
* Different frameworks allows to add observability to app in just a few minutes
  with nearly no code.  [[PM.low_code]]
* the OTel Collector Agent now enables to keep a shared agent for 
  logging, metrics and traces, simplifying the current state with 
  3 different agents for each type of observability instrumentation 
  (OS files, syslog, ... for logs, Jaeger Agent/... for metrics,  OpenCensus/...
   for traces).
* 838 supported frameworks as of 2024.
  * <https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?component=instrumentation&language=java>
  * <https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?component=instrumentation&language=python>

* Emerging Cloud native standard, Made up from a collection of tools (ex: Traefik) , APIs, and SDKs.

[[{monitoring.logging]]
## Open Telemetry logging

* stable API as of 2023-11.

- OTel Logging consists of four core components:
  - OTel log Protocol, describing the encoding, transport, and delivery mechanism of telemetry data between telemetry sources.
  - Logs Bridge API:
  - Log backend API:
  - Logs SDK, targeting final developers of apps


- OTel Collector Agent is backed by a specification data model to support each. [[data.opentelemetry]]

- By leveraging the common collector, logs can be correlated with the rest of 
  the observability data to enhance the interoperability of traces, metrics, and 
  logs.<br/>
  ...  "logs are relatively computationally expensive to capture and tends to use 
  more CPU than people think it should, and secondly, logs tend to be formatted 
  in wildly different ways."
  OEl aims to address these concerns.
 [[doc_has.keypoint]]
- Logging supports First-Party Application Logs, "old" system logs, infra logs, 3rd-party application logs,
  legacy first-party logs, file/stdout logs, and direct to the collector.

## AWS Lambda Telemetry API

* <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-the-aws-lambda-telemetry-api/>

- new API that Lambda extensions can use. It enhances the
existing Lambda Logs API functionality, adding events and traces.

 The schema is semantically compatible with OpenTelemetry.
It can use events received from the Telemetry API to build and
report OTEL spans!

Telemetry API-enabled extensions can be used now to send
telemetry data to Coralogix, Datadog, Dynatrace, Lumigo,
New Relic, Inc., Sumo Logic, Sedai, Sysdig, Site24x7, 
Serverless Inc. Thundra, or custom destinations.

[[{cloud.GCP]]
## OpenTelemetry on GCP

* <https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/09/gcp-opentelemetry-adoption/>

... The enhanced storage system also increases span capacity
significantly. Span names can now contain up to 1,024 bytes rather
than 128 bytes, and individual spans can accommodate up to 1,024
attributes instead of the previous limit of 32. Additionally, the
system now supports 256 events per span and 128 links per span,
providing developers with much greater flexibility in their tracing
implementations.

# OpenTelemetry. What's New

## 2023-11. OpenTelemetry Logging Marked Stable: Morgan McLean at KubeCon NA

* Source: <https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/11/otel-logging-stable/>
Improvements over traditional logging include:
* Sharing common agent for observability data.
* Extending correlation via context propagation across telemetry signals:
* Leveraging semantic conventions of commonly observed concepts, protocols, and operations.
* Enabling the use of an OTel protocol to reduce logging computation overheard
* Compatibility with existing logging frameworks and libraries.


## OpenTelemetry Announces Roadmap for Metrics Specification

<https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/03/opentelemetry-metrics-roadmap/>
  The OpenTelemetry project announced its roadmap for its metrics
  specification. The roadmap includes a stable metrics API/SDK, metrics
  data model and protocol, and compatibility with Prometheus.

## Traefik 3.0 Reverse Proxy Rolls Out With Major Enhancements

* <https://linuxiac.com/traefik-3-0-reverse-proxy/>

.... Traefik 3.0 also extends its observability features, incorporating 
OpenTelemetry to provide state-of-the-art tooling for metrics and tracing, 
supporting a seamless transition from older systems like OpenCensus and 
OpenTracing.
