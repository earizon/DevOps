  to complete source code analysis and assisted code reviews. Chief among them
  is the source{d} Engine, now in public beta; it uses a suite of open source
  tools (such as Gitbase, Babelfish, and Enry) to enable large-scale source
  code analysis. Some key uses of the source{d} Engine include language
  identification, parsing code into abstract syntax trees, and performing SQL
  Queries on your source code such as:
    - What are the top repositories in a codebase based on number of commits?
    - What is the most recent commit message in a given repository?
    - Who are the most prolific contributors in a repository

<span xsmall>Container Networking</span>
@[https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/12/22/container-networking/]
By Julia Evans

""" There are a lot of different ways you can network containers
  together, and the documentation on the internet about how it works is
  often pretty bad. I got really confused about all of this, so I'm
  going to try to explain what it all is in laymen's terms. """

 *what even is container networking?*

  When  a program in a container, you have two main options:
  - run app in host network namespace. (normal networking)
    "host_ip":"app_port"
  - run the program in its own*network namespace*:
   *It turns out that this problem of how to connect *
   *two programs in containers together has a ton of *
   *different solutions. *

- "every container gets an IP".  (k8s requirement)
    "172.16.0.1:8080" // Tomcat continer app 1
    "172.16.0.2:5432" // PostgreSQL container app1
    "172.17.0.1:8080" // Tomcat continer app 2
    ...
    └───────┬───────┘
    any other program in the cluster will target those IP:port
    Instead of single-IP:"many ports" we have "many IPs":"some ports"

   Q: How to get many IPs in a single host?
    - Host IP: 172.9.9.9
    - Container private IP: 10.4.4.4
    - To route from 10.4.4.4 to 172.9.9.9:
    - Alt1: Configure Linux routing tables
    $*$ sudo ip route add 10.4.4.0/24 via 172.23.1.1 dev eth0*
    - Alt2: Use AWS VPC Route tables
    - Alt3: Use Azure ...

 *Encapsulating to other networks:*

  LOCAL NETWORK     REMOTE NETWORK
                    (encapsulation)
  IP: 10.4.4.4      IP: 172.9.9.9
  TCP stuff         (extra wrapper stuff)
  HTTP stuff        IP: 10.4.4.4
                    TCP stuff
                    HTTP stuff

  - 2 different ways of doing encapsulation:
    - "ip-in-ip": add extra IP-header on top "current" IP header.
      MAC:  11:11:11:11:11:11
      IP: 172.9.9.9
      IP: 10.4.4.4
      TCP stuff
      HTTP stuff
      Ex:
      $*$ sudo ip tunnel add mytun mode ipip \       * ← Create tunnel "mytun"
      $*   remote 172.9.9.9 local 10.4.4.4 ttl 255   *
      $*   sudo ifconfig mytun 10.42.1.1             *
      $*$ sudo route add -net 10.42.2.0/24 dev mytun * ← set up a route table
      $*$ sudo route list


    - "vxlan": take whole packet
       (including the MAC address) and wrap
       it inside a UDP packet. Ex:
       MAC address: 11:11:11:11:11:11
       IP: 172.9.9.9
       UDP port 8472 (the "vxlan port")
       MAC address: ab:cd:ef:12:34:56
       IP: 10.4.4.4
       TCP port 80
       HTTP stuff

  - *Every container networking "thing" runs some kind of daemon program *
    *on every box which is in charge of adding routes to the route table.*
    *for automatic route configuration.*
     - Alt1: routes are in etcd cluster, and program talks to the
             etcd cluster to figure out which routes to set.
     - Alt2: use BGP protocol to gossip to each other about routes,
             and a daemon (BIRD) that listens for BGP messages on
             every box.

 *Q: How does that packet actually end up getting to your container program?*
  A: bridge networking
  - Docker/... creates fake (virtual) network interfaces for every
    single one of your containers with a given IP address.
  - The fake interfaces are bridges to a real one.

 *Flannel:*
  - Supports vxlan (encapsulate all packets) and
    host-gw (just set route table entries, no encapsulation)
  - The daemon that sets the routes gets them *from an etcd cluster*.

 *Calico:*
  - Supports ip-in-ip encapsulation and
    "regular" mode, (just set route table entries, no encaps.)
  - The daemon that sets the routes gets them *using BGP messages*
    from other hosts. (etcd is  not used for distributing routes).

<span xsmall>Testcontainers</span>
@[https://www.testcontainers.org/#who-is-using-testcontainers]
- Testcontainers is a Java library that supports JUnit tests,
  providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases,
  Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker
  container.

- Testcontainers make the following kinds of tests easier:

  - Data access layer integration tests: use a containerized instance
    of a MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle database to test your data access
    layer code for complete compatibility, but without requiring complex
    setup on developers' machines and safe in the knowledge that your
    tests will always start with a known DB state. Any other database
    type that can be containerized can also be used.
  - Application integration tests: for running your application in a
    short-lived test mode with dependencies, such as databases, message
    queues or web servers.
  - UI/Acceptance tests: use containerized web browsers, compatible
    with Selenium, for conducting automated UI tests. Each test can get a
    fresh instance of the browser, with no browser state, plugin
    variations or automated browser upgrades to worry about. And you get
    a video recording of each test session, or just each session where
    tests failed.
  - Much more!

CRIU: project to implement checkpoint/restore functionality for Linux.

Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace, or CRIU (pronounced kree-oo, IPA:
/krɪʊ/, Russian: криу), is a Linux software. It can freeze a
running container (or an individual application) and checkpoint its
state to disk. The data saved can be used to restore the application

Used for example to bootstrap JVMs in millisecs (vs secs)
@[/JAVA/java_map.html#?jvm_app_checkpoint]

and run it exactly as it was during the time of the freeze. Using
this functionality, application or container live migration,
snapshots, remote debugging, and many other things are now possible.

<span xsmall>Avoid huge log dumps</span>
https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/12944/any-way-to-limit-docker-logs-output-by-default/12970#12970

- Problem Context:
  - Container output huge logs (maybe gigabytes).
  - $ docker logs 'container' knocks down the host server when output is processed.

- To limit docker logs, specify limits in docker daemon's config file like:
  /etc/docker/daemon.json
  {
    "log-driver": "json-file",
    "log-opts": {
      "max-size": "10m",
      "max-file": "3"
    }
  }
  (then restart docker daemon after edit)
NOTE: maybe ulimit can fix it at global (Linux OS) scope.

...When you’re done with this tutorial you’ll have a small YAML
file that describes your docker image’s desired state. This will
allow you to test this:

  $ docker run -p 8080:80 nginx

  With this:

  $ dgoss run -p 8080:80 nginx

- Goss is a YAML based serverspec alternative tool for validating a
  server’s configuration. It eases the process of writing tests by
  allowing the user to generate tests from the current system state.
  Once the test suite is written they can be executed, waited-on, or
  served as a health endpoint.

https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/workflow-cps-global-lib-http-plugin
The current official plugin workflow-cps-global-lib does provide a way to retrieve shared libraries through a SCM, such as Git. The goal of this plugin is to provide another way to retrieve shared libraries via the @Library declaration in a Jenkinsfile.This is a way to separate to concerns : source code (SCM) and built artefacts (binaries). Built artefacts are immutable, tagged and often stored on a different kind of infrastructure. Since pipelines can be used to make production loads, it makes sense to host the libraries on a server with a production-level SLA for example. You can also make sure that your artefact repository is close to your pipelines and share the same SLA. Having your Jenkins and your artefact repository close limitsr latency and limits network issues.

https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/container-volatile-overlay-mounts
Recent versions of Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O have started to take
advantage of a new kernel feature, volatile overlay mounts. This
feature allows you to mount an overlay file system with a flag that
tells it not to sync to the disk.

https://sysadmin.prod.acquia-sites.com/sysadmin/overlay-mounts

Speed up container builds with overlay mounts
How Podman can speed up builds for multiple distributions by sharing the host's metadata.
Overlay mounts help to address a challenge we run into when we have
several containers on a single host. The basic problem is that every
time you run dnf or yum inside a container, the container downloads
and processes the metadata of all the repositories. To address this,
we added an advanced volume mount to allow all of the containers to
share the host's metadata. This approach avoids repeating the
download and processing for each container. I previously wrote a blog
post introducing the concept of overlay mounts inside of builds.

- git merge strategies: (From Bitbucket UI)
  - Merge commit --no-ff
     Always create a new merge commit and update the target branch to it,
    even if the source branch is already up to date with the target
    branch.
  - Fast-forward --ff
     If the source branch is out of date with the target branch, create a
    merge commit. Otherwise, update the target branch to the latest
    commit on the source branch.
  - Fast-forward only --ff-only
     If the source branch is out of date with the target branch, reject
    the merge request. Otherwise, update the target branch to the latest
    commit on the source branch.

  - Rebase and merge,  rebase + merge --no-ff
      Rebase commits from the source branch onto the target branch,
    creating a new non-merge commit for each incoming commit, and create
    a merge commit to update the target branch.

  - Rebase and fast-forward,  rebase + merge --ff-only
     Rebase commits from the source branch onto the target branch,
    creating a new non-merge commit for each incoming commit, and
    fast-forward the target branch with the resulting commits.

  - Squash,  --squash
    Combine all commits into one new non-merge commit on the target branch.

  - Squash, fast-forward only, --squash --ff-only
    If the source branch is out of date with the target branch, reject
    the merge request. Otherwise, combine all commits into one new
    non-merge commit on the target branch.

https://jamesjoshuahill.github.io/note/2015/02/07/is-your-branch-up-to-date/
Nearly everything you do with git happens on your machine. Don’t
take my word for it. Turn off your wifi and see how many git commands
you can run. You’ll see fetch, pull and push fail without a
connection to your remote, but try the other commands you can think
of: status, commit, checkout, cherry-pick, merge, rebase, diff, log
and see how many times git tells you that you’re up-to-date. How
can you be up-to-date if you’re disconnected?
....
When you run git fetch origin the list of branches and commit history is downloaded from GitHub and synchronised into the clone on your machine. Doing a fetch won’t affect your local branches, so it’s one of the safest git commands you can run. You can fetch as much as you like.

This is how a #GitOps pipeline looks like.
⚫ Firstly, the user changes the code in the Git repository.
⚫ Then a container image gets created, and it is pushed to the container registry.
⚫ It gets updated into a config updater.
⚫ Once a user creates a pull request to merge to a different branch, it deploys to the concerned branch.
⚫ Then it tests whether it is all good or not.
⚫ Once it’s all good, the reviewer will be able to merge it.
⚫ After the merge, it goes to the test branch.
⚫ Once you create a pull request, it will deploy to that test
branch. Below are a few popular GitOps tools that you must try while
working on GitOps workflows. • Flux: Flux was created in 2016 by
Weaveworks. It is a GitOps operator for your Kubernetes cluster. •
ArgoCD: ArgoCD is also a GitOps operator but with a web user
interface. • Jenkins X: A CICD solution for Kubernetes clusters but
different than classic Jenkins. • WKSctl: A GitOps tool that uses
Git commits to manage the Kubernetes cluster. • Gitkube: Gitkube is
ideal for development where it uses Git push to build and deploy
docker images on a Kubernetes cluster. • Helm Operator: an
open-source Kubernetes operator to manage helm chart releases
declaratively. Know more about GitOps: http://bit.ly/393ahpv

- git-pw requires patchwork v2.0, since it uses the
  new REST API and other improvements, such as understanding
  the difference between patches, series and cover letters,
  to know exactly what to try and apply.

- python-based tool that integrates git and patchwork.

  $ pip install --user git-pw

CONFIG:
  $ git config pw.server https://patchwork.kernel.org/api/1.1
  $ git config pw.token YOUR_USER_TOKEN_HERE

*Daily work example: finding and applying series*

- Alternative 1: Manually
  - We could use patchwork web UI search engine for it.
    - Go to "linux-rockchip" project
    - click on _"Show patches with" to access the filter menu.
    - filter by submitter.

- Alternative 2: git-pw (REST API wrapper)
  - $ git-pw --project linux-rockchip series list "dynamically"

  - Applying the entire series (or at least trying to):
    $ git-pw series apply 95139
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    fetch all the patches in the series, and apply them in the right order.

Git 2.37 Brings Built-in File Monitor, Improved Pruning, and More @mahttps://www.infoq.com/news/2022/06/git-2-37-released/ 
According to Jeff Hostetler, the author of the patches for git's new file monitor, the implementation relies mostly on cross-platform code with custom backends leveraging OS-native features, i.e. FSEvents on macOS and ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows. A Linux backend would probably use either inotify or fanotify, Hostetler says, but that work has not started yet.

__________________________DevOps: Git and ssh keysIn our last post, we talked about SSH signing: a new feature in Git that allows you to use the SSH key you likely already have in order to sign certain kinds of objects in Git.This release includes a couple of new additions to SSH signing. Suppose you use SSH keys to sign objects in a project you work on. To track which SSH keys you trust, you use the allowed signers file to store the identities and public keys of signers you trust.Now suppose that one of your collaborators rotates their key. What do you do? You could update their entry in the allowed signers file to point at their new key, but that would make it impossible to validate objects signed with the older key. You could store both keys, but that would mean that you would accept new objects signed with the old key.Git 2.35 lets you take advantage of OpenSSH’s valid-before and valid-after directives by making sure that the object you’re verifying was signed using a signature that was valid when it was created. This allows individuals to rotate their SSH keys by keeping track of when each key was valid without invalidating any objects previously signed using an older key.Git 2.35 also supports new key types in the user.signingKey configuration when you include the key verbatim (instead of storing the path of a file that contains the signing key). Previously, the rule for interpreting user.signingKey was to treat its value as a literal SSH key if it began with “ssh-“, and to treat it as filepath otherwise. You can now specify literal SSH keys with keytypes that don’t begin with “ssh-” (like ECDSA keys).[source, source]_____________________________________

Problema: Los devs pican código que es imposible de desplegar de lo 
mierda que es (a veces no pueden ni ejecutarlo en sus propias 
maquinas...).

Solución: Pues lo encapsulamos en contenedores, emulando su propia maquina.

Problema: Ahora tenemos 500 contenedores. Todo es ridículamente difícil de manejar.
Solución: Pues lo solucionamos con orquestradores de contenedores.

Problema: Los orquestradores son ridículamente complejos de manejar 
          y están añadiendo otra capa más de complejidad, por no hablar de 
          la fuente de problemas exóticos en la que se han convertido. 
          (Kubernetes, alguien?)
Solución: "están en ello, estoy seguro que nos sorprenderán"

How to Use S3 as a Private Git Repository – Fancy Beans
https://fancybeans.com/2012/08/24/how-to-use-s3-as-a-private-git-repository/ 

Basically, use git for local commands that manipulate the local 
repository (adding, committing, merging) and jgit for any 
interactions that involve sending or receiving data from the S3 
bucket.

https://github.com/bgahagan/git-remote-s3
Push and pull git repos to/from an s3 bucket. Uses gpg to encrypt the 
repo contents (but not branch names!) before sending to s3.


https://www.petekeen.net/hosting-private-git-repositories-with-gitolite

Step 1: Install Gitolite

Gitolite is a system for managing git repositories using git itself 
to manage the configuration. Essentially, after initial configuration 
you make all changes by editing a config file, committing it, and 
pushing up to your git server.

Gitolite installation is pretty straightforward:

● Portainer UI:[[{]]
(See also LazyDocker)
• Portainer, an open-source management interface used to manage a
  Docker host, Swarm and k8s cluster.
• It's used by software engineers and DevOps teams to simplify and
  speed up software deployments.
