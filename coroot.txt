# coroot: monitoringr+troubleshooting agent for containers and decoupled architectures.

* <https://github.com/coroot/coroot>

  Node-agent turns terabytes of logs into just a few dozen metrics by extracting
repeated patterns right on the node, allowing to quickly and cost-effectively
find the errors relevant to a particular outage.

* Thanks to eBPF, it reports a comprehensive map of services WITHOUT ANY CODE CHANGES.

* It also use "cloud metadata" to show which regions and availability zones each application
  runs in. This is very important to known, because:
  - Network latency between availability zones within the same region
    can be higher than within one particular zone.
  - Data transfer between availability zones in the same region is
    paid, while data transfer within a zone is free.
