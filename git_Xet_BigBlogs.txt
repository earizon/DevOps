## Xet Storage (by HuggingFace)

* <https://github.com/huggingface/xet-core>

xet-core enables huggingface_hub to utilize xet storage for uploading and 
downloading to HF Hub. Xet storage provides chunk-based deduplication, 
efficient storage/retrieval with local disk caching, and backwards 
compatibility with Git LFS. This library is not meant to be used directly, and 
is instead intended to be used from huggingface_hub.
