## Best Screen Recorders for Wayland in Linux [Compared & Tested]

* <https://www.debugpoint.com/screen-recorders-linux-wayland/>

### Desktop recording in Wayland thanks to Pipeware

* <https://www.debugpoint.com/2020/07/kde-plasma-5-20-wayland/>
* <https://pipewire.org/>
- It provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine on top of
  audio and video devices that can be used to support the use cases
  currently handled by both pulseaudio and JACK. PipeWire was designed
  with a powerful security model that makes interacting with audio and
  video devices from containerized applications easy, with supporting
  Flatpak applications being the primary goal. Alongside Wayland and
  Flatpak we expect PipeWire to provide a core building block for the
  future of Linux application development

## Endless OS: "Git like" OS updates.

* <https://support.endlessos.org/en/endless-os/updates>

 With OSTree, keeping a previous version of the OS does not double the
disk space used: only the differences between the two versions need
to be stored. For minor upgrades (such as 3.4.0 to 3.4.1) the
difference is typically only a few megabytes. For major upgrades
(such as 3.3.x to 3.4.x) the difference is significantly larger, but
the ability to roll back to the old version is even more valuable.

* <https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/>

  As implied above, libostree is both a shared library and suite of
command line tools that combines a "git-like" model for
committing and downloading bootable filesystem trees, along with a
layer for deploying them and managing the bootloader configuration.
The core OSTree model is like git in that it checksums individual
files and has a content-addressed-object store. It’s unlike git in
that it “checks out” the files via hardlinks, and they thus need
to be immutable to prevent corruption. Therefore, another way to
think of OSTree is that it’s just a more polished version of Linux
VServer hardlinks.

Features:
- Transactional upgrades and rollback for the system
- Replicating content incrementally over HTTP via GPG signatures and
  "pinned TLS" support
- Support for parallel installing more than just 2 bootable roots
- Binary history on the server side (and client)
- Introspectable shared library API for build and deployment systems
- Flexible support for multiple branches and repositories, supporting
  projects like flatpak which use libostree for applications, rather
  than hosts.

  Endless OS uses libostree for their host system as well as flatpak.
See their eos-updater and deb-ostree-builder projects.

* Fedora derivatives use rpm-ostree (noted below); there are 4 variants 
using OSTree:
- Fedora CoreOS
- Fedora Silverblue
- Fedora Kinoite
- Fedora IoT

* GNOME Continuous is where OSTree was born - as a high performance 
continuous delivery/testing system for GNOME.

* OSTree is in many ways very evolutionary. It builds on concepts and
ideas introduced from many different projects such as Systemd
Stateless, Systemd Bootloader Spec, Chromium Autoupdate, the much
older Fedora/Red Hat Stateless Project, Linux VServer and many more.

## WirePlumber in Fedora 35

* <https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/wireplumber-in-fedora-35.html>

...WirePlumber as the default session manager for PipeWire! ... previously adopted in
the automotive space by Automotive Grade Linux... it is now the recommended session
manager to accompany PipeWire

... WirePlumber brings some new and interesting things to the desktop. Most notably, it
introduces the ability to easily modify the overall behavior of PipeWire for different 
use cases, using Lua scripts ... customize multimedia experience...

Real OS for Smartphones

Writing packages is easy, by the way: as long as you know how to 
write shell scripts, you are good to go. We have continuous 
integration in place that makes sure everything builds that gets 
submitted to our packages repository, among other sanity checks.
