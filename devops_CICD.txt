# Source{d}: Large Scale Code Analysis with IA
<https://www.linux.com/blog/holberton/2018/10/sourced-engine-simple-elegant-way-analyze-your-code>

* source{d} offers a suite of applications that uses machine learning on code
  to complete source code analysis and assisted code reviews. Chief among them
  is the source{d} Engine, now in public beta; it uses a suite of open source
  tools (such as Gitbase, Babelfish, and Enry) to enable large-scale source
  code analysis. Some key uses of the source{d} Engine include language
  identification, parsing code into abstract syntax trees, and performing SQL
  Queries on your source code such as:
    * What are the top repositories in a codebase based on number of commits?
    * What is the most recent commit message in a given repository?
    * Who are the most prolific contributors in a repository
