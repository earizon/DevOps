  https://osv.io/ OSv - the cloud OS
  OSv is the open-source versatile modular unikernel designed to run
  unmodified Linux applications securely on micro-VMs in the cloud.
  Built from the ground up for effortless deployment and management of
  micro-services and serverless apps, with superior performance.

  OSv supports many managed language runtimes including unmodified JVM,
  Python 2 and 3, Node.JS, Ruby, Erlang as well as languages compiling
  directly to native machine code like Golang and Rust.

- Mirage OS, http://www.openmirage.org/
  Mirage OS is a library operating system that constructs unikernels
  for secure, high-performance network applications across a variety
  of cloud computing and mobile platforms.  Code can be developed on a normal OS
  such as Linux or MacOS X, and then compiled into a fully-standalone,
  specialised unikernel that runs under the Xen hypervisor.</li>

- Fiasco.OC kernel http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/fiasco/
  Fiasco is a preemptible real-time µ-kernel (microkernel)
  running on various platforms, supporting hard priorities and
  usin non-blocking synchronization for its kernel objects
  that guarants priority inheritance and makes sure that
  runnable high-priority processes never block waiting for
  lower-priority processes. It can be used to construct
  flexible systems.
   It is the base for the TUDO:OS system supporting real-time,
  time-sharing and virtualization applications concurrently on
  one computer.
    Fiasco.OC is also suitable for embbeded up to big&complex systems.
  "" We have developed the L4 Runtime Environment which
     provides the necessary infrastructure on top of Fiasco.OC
     for conveniently developing applications.
     Please refer to the Features page for more information on
     the capabilities of Fiasco.OC. """

  L4.verified: Formal functional correctness verified kernel:
  Trustworthy Systems represents the confluence of "FORMAL METHODS" and
  OSes, applying the former in the context of the latter,
  and advancing the state of the art in both areas.

  Aim: Unprecedented security, safety, reliability and efficiency
       for software systems, and especially critical cyber-physical systems.
  Approach: large, complex, performant systems, built on a
      formally verified microkernel isolating untrusted components from
      formally verified or correct-by-construction synthesised trusted
      components. Formal, machine-checked proof for safety and security
      properties on the code level for systems with over a million lines
